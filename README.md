# tuxbot-linux

TuxBot is a free open-source assistant for various platforms. This is the Linux Version for TuxBot (tested on Debian and Ubuntu).
You may also download the sources for Windows platform [here](https://github.com/eduardogc/tuxbot-windows).

## Features
In this version of the program, you may do:
* **Talk** with the robot by text;
* **Open** various programs on your machine, with a single command (a first config is necessary, telling robot to "edit paths");
* **Search** on web, using Bing or Google with the default browser;
* **Measure** work time defining start day, lunch time, back lunch time and finish day. This feature also saves the time on a CSV file.
* Make some calculation;
* Search files on computer (needs some fixes, but it works ;) )

## Installation

Put TuxBot anywhere you want and run installation-linux.sh on terminal. No additional setup need.

## TODO and future work

This version is the most stable version for Linux at the moment, but it is still on development, and you certain find
a lot of bugs on it. Future versions with more stable code and more functionality will be available soon, but be free to
download and use it for your own purpose. Also, suggestions of features/bug fixes are welcome =]
